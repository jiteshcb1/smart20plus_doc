      <p>Each student has a different capacity and catering to each one of them in a class environment is quite difficult. Every student needs to be handled according to his/her skills and capacity. As some students are not catered according to their needs or some students who work hard but not smartly or in the right direction, it is often seen that they are not able to do well. Even parents face difficulty in tracking their child's development and help him grow more Catering to each student also increases the teacher's work-load. And it is even more difficult for the institute to track and supervise each student and teacher.</p>
      <p>For this, an effective, time-saving, and easy approach is required and needs to be implemented efficiently. This is where smart20 comes in to help.</p>

        <p>SMART20+ focuses on the idea of intellectual growth rather than just learning. Learning is not just about reading and mugging up concepts it's about having a smooth understanding of concepts along with cognitive skills like good memory, observation skills, etc.
        </p>

        <p>The main idea of this edu-tech solution is to give students the opportunity to improve their understanding of subject concepts through the latest proprietary technology by SAARC MastsTech.</p>
        <p>A personal learning solution for students which understands their individual learning capacity. As well as, it analyses each student's cognitive skills and then provides the personalized need of subject-concepts clarification.</p>

        <p>Smart20+ uses LMS approach for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation and delivery of educational courses. It uses a combination of AI, ML, DL, and neural networks which helps students decide on the concept, pick question papers and improve on their learning abilities and memory retention. For teachers, the same technique in SMART20+, helps in sorting our students according to their needs and helps them learn in-depth.</p>

        <p>It helps teachers to know the weaknesses and strengths of each student and also reduces the workload like setting the paper, checking it, etc. It also saves time which ultimately helps in diving deep into the topic.</p>

        <p>As it supervises each teacher and student it also becomes easy for the institute to track the performance of each student and teacher and also helps the parent to see the development of their child and get involved in the process.</p>

        <p>The working of the app is as follows:-
        </p>
        <ul id="listtheme">
          <li>First of all, The institution needs to register themselves in the app providing all the details of their staffs, students, and their respective roles in the organization.</li>
          <li>If registration gets validated than all their data will get stored in the database. </li>
          <li>Then, the user will first need to register them, than according to the details sent by their organization they will be allot their module.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="wf1.jpg" height = "400" style="padding-left: 20px;"/>
        <p><strong><u>Note</u></strong>:-<i>The application consists of 4 sections, namely:- Students, Teachers, Institute, Parents. </i></p>
        <p><strong>Student Module:-</strong></p>

        <ul id="listtheme">
          <li>Students can login to the application and if the login credentials are correct then they can proceed further or else it will take the user back to the login screen.</li>
          <li>After successfull login, a student can select the course and study it, they can also ask doubts and continue studying again and give tests after it.</li>
          <li>The test results will be analyised and the student growth gets updated in the database as well as the course is updated with the new data.</li>
          <li>After the test , a student can continue studying and if the course is completed then they can either select a new course or end it.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="wf2.jpg" width="400" height = "450" style="padding-left: 20px;"/>
        <p><strong>Teacher Module:-</strong></p>
        <ul id="listtheme">
          <li>Initially teacher has to sign-up/register and after verification of credentials, he/she can log in and proceed further to see the details of students who have enrolled in his/her courses.
          </li>
          <li>Also, the teacher can see if any student has raised any doubts so that he/she can resolve the doubts of the respective student and can check what's progress report (like their strength/weakness) of the students enrolled so that he/she can prepare tests accordingly.</li>
          <li>At last, the teacher adds remarks based on the student's progress regularly and it gets saved in the database so that parents can checkout how their son/daughter is performing.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="wf3.png" height = "500" style="padding-left: 20px;"/>
        <p><strong>Parents and Institute module:-</strong></p>
        <ul id="listtheme">
          <li>Parents login and get to know strength and weakness of their child. They get to know where his/her child is lacking which helps them to know how they can help their child.</li>
          <li>Institute can login and tracks all the students and teachers which help them to supervise each one of them. On the basis, of the data available, institute can take further decision regarding each individual.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="wf4.jpg" height = "400" style="padding-left: 20px;"/>

         Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>   <img src="pic-3.png" height="340" style="float:right; padding-left: 10px;"/><br>With SMART20+ personalized learning solution, students will be able to develop their skills making concept comprehension easy as well as allow them to clarify the same concept multiple times till absolute clarification.
        </p>
        <p> Teachers will be able to know the weakness, strengths, and progress of each student. They will be able to explain the concept more thoroughly which might be difficult in a classroom setup.</p>
        <p>
          With such an approach, the Principal of the institution is empowered with thorough knowledge about each teacher and each student. This will allow the institute to keep track of everything as even the minutest learning-teaching activity is under control. It provides an effective, time-saving, and easy approach to understand the capacities of each teacher and student, which is impossible otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>With SMART20+ the parents now can monitor the child's academic performance in a holistic way. They will get to know where their child is lacking and will be able to get a clear picture of how the intellectual development of their child is progressing. This will allow parents to become part of their child's academic process.
          </p>
          <p>Hence with this, we can conclude that SMART20+ is not just any other edu-tech software. It is much beyond that allowing students to acquire high intellectual growth, have a smooth understanding of concepts along with cognitive skills like good memory, observation skills, etc.</p>
